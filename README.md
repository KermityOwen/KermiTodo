## Run-From-Source Manual:
This section will explain how to run the application directly from the source code using your own installation of Python. (If you simply want an executable, look at the Executable Manual section below.)

#### Step-by-step Python Setup:
- Clone the entire directory into your desired location
- Create or activate a python environment (Conda, Pyenv, or Global) in the directory
- Install all dependencies using ```pip install -r ./requirements.txt``` (Currently only Rich)
- Run ```python main.py``` and enjoy :)
